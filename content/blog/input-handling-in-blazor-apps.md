# Input Handling in Blazor Apps: @bind vs @oninput vs @onchange Usage

<p>
Blazor provides various ways to handle input fields, making it a powerful framework for building interactive web applications. In this post, we'll delve into three key directives for handling inputs: @bind, @oninput, and @onchange. Understanding when and how to use each of these can significantly enhance the responsiveness and functionality of your Blazor applications.</p>

## @bind for Data Binding

The @bind directive is a fundamental feature in Blazor, offering two-way data binding between an input field and a property. This ensures that any change in the input field's value is instantly reflected in the bound property, and vice versa.

### Usage Scenario:



<ol class="list-disc">
 
  <li>Complex Forms: In scenarios where you have complex forms with multiple input fields, @bind provides a seamless way to keep the form data synchronized with your data model. This is particularly useful in form-heavy applications like data entry systems or admin panels.</li>
    <li>Real-Time Updates: When you need real-time synchronization between the UI and the data model, @bind is the go-to choice. It ensures that any user input is immediately reflected in the application state.</li>
</ol>

### Example:


 ```
 <input type="text" @bind="userName" />
<p>Your username is: @userName</p>
 ```

To begin, install the necessary packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash

### Step 3: Create Tailwind CSS File

### Step 4: Options

### Step 5: Nuxt Content Module Adjustment

If you're using the Nuxt Content module, adjust your tailwind.config.js file to include paths to your blog-related files:

```bash
/**@type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [

    "./layouts/**/*.vue",
    "./pages/**/*.vue",
    "./plugins/**/*.{js,ts}",
    "./nuxt.config.{js,ts}",
